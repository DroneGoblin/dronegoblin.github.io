Hi! I'm Drone Goblin—technically a person, spiritually a raccoon with wings.

I started this blog to track my experience learning how to fly drones, shoot amazing footage, and someday make a living doing what I love (and sometimes fear). If you've ever looked at a drone and thought, *"Can I break this for fun and profit?"*—you're in the right place.

Thanks for joining me on this high-flying, low-margin adventure.
